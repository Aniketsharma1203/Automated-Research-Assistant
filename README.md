Automated Research Assistant with DSPy and AutoGen
This project is a powerful demonstration of building robust, multi-agent AI systems using two cutting-edge frameworks: DSPy for creating reliable, self-optimizing "tools" and AutoGen for orchestrating a team of AI agents to solve complex tasks.

The system functions as an automated research assistant that can take a high-level topic, find relevant information, and synthesize it into a concise literature review.

üß† Core Concepts & Architecture
This project moves beyond simple, brittle prompting to a more programmatic and structured approach to building with LLMs. The architecture mimics a real-world research team.

AutoGen: The AI Project Manager ü§ñ
AutoGen serves as the high-level orchestrator. It creates and manages a conversation between different AI agents, each with a specific role. In this project, we have:

Research Manager: The team lead that communicates with the user and directs the workflow.

Researcher: The specialist that executes tasks by using the tools provided to it.

DSPy: The Expert Tool Builder üõ†Ô∏è
DSPy is used to build the specialized, high-performance "tools" that the AutoGen agents use. Instead of relying on fragile prompt engineering, DSPy allows us to define the logic of a task (its inputs and outputs). We then use a DSPy optimizer to "compile" this logic, finding the most effective and reliable prompt for the underlying LLM. This makes each tool a robust, optimized program.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.9+

A Groq API Key (free to create)

2. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/dspy-autogen-researcher.git
cd dspy-autogen-researcher
3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Install Dependencies
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: If you don't have a requirements.txt file yet, create one with pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing the necessary packages manually.)

5. Configure Environment Variables
Rename the .env.example file (if you have one) to .env or create a new file named .env.

Add your Groq API key to the .env file:

Ini, TOML

GROQ_API_KEY="your-new-secure-groq-key"
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
To run the automated research assistant, execute the main script from the root directory:

Bash

python main.py
The agents will begin their conversation in the terminal, executing the research plan step-by-step.

üó∫Ô∏è Future Roadmap
This project provides a solid foundation. Here are some potential improvements:

Compile DSPy Modules: Implement dspy.compile with a few-shot optimizer (BootstrapFewShot) to dramatically improve the reliability of the tools.

Add a Critic Agent: Introduce a third AutoGen agent to review and provide feedback on the generated literature review, creating an iterative improvement loop.

PDF Parsing: Add a tool using a library like PyMuPDF to allow the assistant to read and summarize academic papers from PDF files.

Integrate a Search API: Replace the basic web scraper with a robust search API like Tavily for more reliable and agent-optimized search results.
